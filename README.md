# android-application-test
## How to start
Please create a new Android project within this folder.

Your task is to create a login screen and (empty) home page. The login screen has two text fields (an email and a password), and a "Confirm" button.

The email and password is part of a POST request with a content type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. 

- The base URL is `https://api-staging.loylap.com/api/v2/` 
- The end point is `auth/login/email`. 
- Please supply `conor@loylap.com` as the `email` and `Loylap1947!` as the `password`.

With a successful reponse, navigate to a home screen.

The visuals don't matter here, focus more on the project dependencies and structure. 

In order of precedence we will look at:
- Package structure and architecture
- Dependencies
- Exception handling
- Tests
- Visuals or extras

Spend about 30-45 mins on the project, zip it and email conor@loylap.com and daniel@loylap.com when it is complete with a link to zipped work.
